\f0\fs24 \cf0 VR Team, you will be creating your own project file for the VR build. I\'92ll let you decide on how you want to set up the file system for your build. You will also be in charge of getting assets from the other teams into your build, probably through having them create packages for you. If you need someone to send you assets, get in contact with them and have them send you a pull request with the package through GitHub. }
